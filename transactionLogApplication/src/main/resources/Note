1. mybatis-config is useless now because we have the "org.mybatis-spring-starter" dependency
2. By using @Mapper at our Mapper interface, we can let Spring takes care of the Mappers so we dont even need the SQLSession thing anymore

4. Controller had setup to bring SQL information to the web page
5. transactionMapperTest needs mybatis-config to work, because the sqlSession factory needs that to build a session
